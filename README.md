TDK64 - a PIC-based USB adapter for N64 game pads
=================================================

You will need [Microchip MLA](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/microchip-libraries-for-applications) for the USB libraries.

The USB VID and PID have been chosen arbitrarily; they might cause conflicts that need to be resolved.

Warning
-------

This is an old project that I haven't updated in a while. `cheat.c` is not included because it's an easter egg that I implemented for my version.

It should work, from the last time I tested it. There is a KiCAD schematic included in the `n64` directory.

Have fun!
