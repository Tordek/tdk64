TDK64 - a PIC-based USB adapter for N64 game pads
=================================================

#Warning
This is an old project that I haven't updated in a while. `cheat.c` is not included because it's an easter egg that I implemented for my version.

It should work, from the last time I tested it. There is a KiCAD schematic included in the `n64` directory.

Have fun!
